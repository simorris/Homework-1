<h2 class="titletop"> About Mike </h2>
<p> 
I grew up in Bowling Green, a small, farm town in northeast Missouri.  I'm a 40 year old father with two boys (ages 8 &amp; 11) and one wife (so far).  
Amy and I have been together since high school so I'm liking the odds.  I've lived in Missouri, Illinois, Indiana, and Iowa.  
I've been a grocery store carry-out, driven dump trucks and backhoes for the city street department, organized youth sports
at a YMCA and summer camps, interned at a municipal recreation department and graduated with a BS in Parks and Recreation Management with some computer courses.
After graduation I spent time as an EMT, a short time working as a community support person for people with mental illness, and a very short time (2 weeks)
as a furniture salesman. 
</p>

<p>
I was sucked up in the Internet bubble in the late 90s.  Bill Gates Foundation gave several million to St. Louis Public Library for technology improvements. I
landed a job installing new PCs in the different branches around the city.  After a few weeks my job duties expanded to include helping configure WAN links and I
was introduced to computer and network security.
</p>

<p>
After leaving St. Louis I spent time working as a contractor doing phone tech support for McCleod USA sales people.  I eventually ended up at
Kinze Manufacturing for several years.  I worked as network and system administrator and was involved in several major projects and system implementations.
After graduation, Amy started teaching at the University of Notre Dame.  The first year I was a stay at home dad and then I started teaching as an adjunct
in Fall 2005.  In 2007 my wife and I landed back at the University of Iowa.

<h2 class="title"> Mike's Close Encounters With Fame </h2>
<ol>

<li> I went to college and was in the same fraternity at the same time as the lead singer from <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/se/artist/revolution-one/id422336448">Revolution One</a>.  He was a DJ for me during a middle school dance at the YMCA.</li>

<li> At SLPL, I worked with Jeff Sporleder, whose brother Greg Sporleder was in The Rock and had a guest appearance on Friends</li>

<li> I worked several years with Ashton Kutcher's aunt.  She was the Application Development Team Lead</li>

<li> About a year ago, Lyle Lovett gave a manly nod to my friend Vince at the Minneapolis airport.  Lyle Lovett was married to Julia Roberts 
who was in Flatliners with Kevin Bacon  ... making me four degrees from Kevin Bacon <br /> ... making you five degrees!  You're welcome!</li>
